# Guidance Popup Feature Documentation

## Overview
The SolvingScreen now features an interactive guidance popup that explains how to use the solving feature, replacing the previous settings navigation.

- No contextual help was available for the solving feature

### After
- The same guidance icon now shows a beautiful animated popup
- Popup provides step-by-step instructions for solving problems
- Includes helpful pro tips for better coding practices

## Features

- **Adaptive theming**: Works with both light and dark themes

1. **Read the Problem** - Guides users to understand the problem statement
2. **Write Your Solution** - Explains the code editor features
3. **Submit & Test** - Describes the submission process
4. **Pro Tips** - Advanced coding best practices

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to any SolvingScreen** (when viewing a coding problem)
2. **Tap the guidance icon** in the top-right corner of the app bar

## Technical Implementation

- **Component**: `GuidancePopup.kt` - Reusable animated popup component
- **Integration**: Modified `MainScreen.kt` AppBar to show popup instead of navigation
- **State Management**: Uses Compose's `remember` for popup visibility state
- **Animations**: Utilizes Compose Animation APIs for smooth transitions

The popup enhances user experience by providing contextual help right where users need it, without navigating away from their current task.
